This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically detect Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) from medical text. Both a baseline machine learning model and a transformer-based DistilBERT model are used and compared.

Project Overview

Detect ADR-related sentences from medical text
Use ADE Corpus V2 dataset
Compare traditional ML vs. transformer models
Evaluate model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Perform error analysis for better understanding

Dataset

ADE Corpus V2
Binary classification: ADR vs Non-ADR
Contains labeled medical sentences
Split into Train / Validation / Test
